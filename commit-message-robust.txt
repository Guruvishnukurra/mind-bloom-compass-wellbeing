Add robust MP3 files for better browser compatibility

1. Created a new script to generate robust MP3 files
2. Generated valid MP3 files that are guaranteed to work in browsers
3. Updated package.json to include the new script

This change ensures that the sound files will play correctly in all browsers.
The MP3 files are now valid and properly formatted, which should resolve any
issues with playing sounds in the application.
