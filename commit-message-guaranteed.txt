Add script to create guaranteed MP3 files during build

1. Created a new script to generate guaranteed MP3 files
2. Updated package.json to use the new script for build and dev
3. Ensured MP3 files are created with valid audio data

This change ensures that valid MP3 files are created during the build process,
not by the end users. The application will work out of the box with the generated
sound files, which are guaranteed to work in all browsers.
