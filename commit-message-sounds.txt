Include sound files in repository

1. Added all required sound files directly in the repository
2. Removed sound download scripts from package.json
3. Updated README.md to reflect that sound files are included
4. Added new script for downloading reliable sounds

This change ensures that users don't have to download sound files separately.
The application will work out of the box with the included sound files.
