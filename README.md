# Project Name:
Mind Bloom ‚Äì Compass for Wellbeing

# Project Abstract:
Mind Bloom is a mental wellness platform designed to promote emotional health, self-awareness, and mindfulness among individuals. It combines AI-powered interactions with mood tracking and habit-building tools to help users manage stress, anxiety, and everyday mental challenges. The platform provides a safe, stigma-free digital space for self-reflection, learning, and guided improvement in mental wellbeing.  

Using Supabase for authentication and data storage, the app ensures secure handling of user information. An AI-powered assistant (integrated via OpenAI API) helps users with personalized wellness advice and journaling prompts. The intuitive and responsive interface is built with React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-ui for a modern, engaging user experience.

# Tech Stack:

- **UI / Styling:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui  
- **Backend / Database:** Supabase  
- **AI / NLP:** OpenAI API  
- **Hosting / Deployment:** Vercel  

# Dataset Used (if any):
