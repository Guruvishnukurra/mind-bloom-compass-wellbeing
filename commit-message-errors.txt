Update sound file error messages

1. Updated error messages in CalmingSounds component
2. Updated error messages in MeditationTimer component
3. Removed references to downloading sound files in error messages

These changes improve the user experience by providing more helpful error messages
when there are issues playing sound files, rather than suggesting users need to
download files that are already included in the repository.
