Add automatic sound file download during build process

1. Created a new script to download sound files during build
2. Updated package.json to run the download script before build
3. Updated README.md to reflect the new build process

This change ensures that sound files are downloaded automatically during the build process,
not by the end users. The application will work out of the box with the downloaded sound files,
and fallback files are created if the download fails.
