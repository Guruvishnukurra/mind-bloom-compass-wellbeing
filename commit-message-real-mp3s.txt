Add script to download real MP3 files during build

1. Created a new script to download real MP3 files from Pixabay
2. Updated package.json to use the new script for build and dev
3. Ensured fallback files are created if download fails

This change ensures that real MP3 files are downloaded during the build process,
not by the end users. The application will work out of the box with the downloaded
sound files, and fallback files are created if the download fails.
